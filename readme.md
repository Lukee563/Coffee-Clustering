## Coffee Consumer Business Analysis
### Clustering Consumers with Survey Responses

Working with a Coffee Consumer Survey Data Set from The Great American Coffee Taste Test (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-05-14/readme.md) to establish if individuals can be grouped into customer classes based on high-level survey data. Using Grower/PMA cluster analysis, individuals are grouped into clusters through survey responses such as their daily coffee consumption information, their preferred location to drink/purchase coffee, and their preferred drinks and roasts.  


## Project I
Using data from a 2023 survey of “Great American Coffee Taste Test” viewers, I will be exploring consumer trends of American coffee enthusiasts, primarily through spending demographics and coffee preferences.
